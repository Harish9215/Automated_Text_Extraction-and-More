# 🚀 Automated Data Extraction from PDFs 📄
Effortlessly extract structured data from unstructured PDF documents!

## 🌟 Overview

This project develops a state-of-the-art Automated Data Extraction Tool designed to process PDF documents and convert their content into structured datasets. By combining the power of OCR, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning, the tool achieves high accuracy and efficiency in extracting information.

Whether you’re working with text-based PDFs or image-heavy documents, this tool simplifies data processing for industries like finance, healthcare, and academia.

### ✨ Features
